# 📊 Power BI – Data Extraction and Manipulation Dashboard

This repository contains a Power BI project focused on analyzing **production data** from multiple manufacturing lines and plants. It demonstrates data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization techniques for performance monitoring and operational decision-making.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to **extract, manipulate, and visualize** production line data to provide insights into:

- Production speed and volume
- Performance metrics per plant and line
- Downtime analysis and causes of failures
- Month-over-month growth and efficiency trends

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **DAX**
- **Data Modeling & Relationships**
- **KPI and Dashboard Design**

## 📈 Key Visuals and Metrics

- **Total Units Produced:** Monthly and cumulative breakdown
- **Line & Plant Performance:** Speed, uptime, and full-performance percentages
- **Failures Overview:** Number of breakdowns, percentage of time affected
- **Growth Trends:** MoM production changes with visual indicators
- **Targets vs Actuals:** Visual representation of production goals per line
- **Performance by Line:** Speed comparison, output contribution, and growth

## 🔍 Insights & Observations

- Majority of the production (~85%) is concentrated in **Plant 1**
- Notable efficiency with **~96% full performance** operation time
- Breakdown events have been effectively categorized by month and line
- Visualization includes a **clear MoM growth pattern**, assisting in strategic planning

## 📂 Files Included

- `PowerBI-Obtencion_Manipulacion.pbix`: Power BI file with the full dashboard and data model
- `PowerBI-Obtencion_Manipulacion.pdf`: PDF export of the dashboard (for preview)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop
2. Explore the reports and interact with filters
3. Use the model to experiment with additional visualizations or KPIs

## 💡 Possible Improvements

- Include dynamic data sources or real-time streaming
- Add drill-through pages for detailed failure causes or specific timeframes
- Incorporate R/Python scripts for predictive maintenance
